MVP:
  - As students at DBC, we know what it's like to have all sorts of questions. And we're not always sure who is best to approach to answer our questions. We are building a platform where DBC students can log onto and create an account. Students are then able to post questions on the web platform, and other students can post answers in response to our questions.

Additional Features:
  - The student who posts a pecific question wants the next person to read his thread to find the best answer quickly, so they should be able to select a 'Best Answer' from all of answers.

  - Users should also be able to upvote any kind of question, answer, or comment, if they deem that content to be usefull.
